					<h1>What is Gamers Club?</h1>
					<p>A very nice place where you can learn about any games you like and their reivews I write. The label “video game” casts an absurdly large net over a whole lot of different things. There are a million different kinds of video games, and each of them sorta functions as its own form of entertainment media. Since we don’t have concrete labels for all those individual types — just loose genre descriptions — we just say everything is a video game. It’s confusing, even to those of us you’d call gamers. Video games are sports that take place in a computer. They’re interactive TV shows and interactive movies. They’re digital board games and card games. They’re rough simulations of everyday life including, probably, whatever you do for a living. Some video games are works of artistic expression. Others don’t know what artistic expression is or why you would care about whatever that is. </p>
