			Hello again, I'm all new here - I mean with blog thing- so it's really brand new for me! You may ask, "WHO YOU ARE?? WHY ARE YOU HERE?? WHO ARE YOU GIVING ADVICE TO US?" You are right... THEREFORE WE SHOULD GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER! My name is Ece Yalçın and I'm 20 y.o. I'm studying at Bogazici University, in the Computer Education and Educational Technology department, in Turkey. I'm a music & art enthusiast who is also very foodie. I also really love playing video games like Valorant, Assasin's Creed etc. Therefore I've created here, in order to share my passion with other gamers. Anyways, most of my friends call me "Owner of refined tastes", for the times they don't do so, they'd like me to call "Ceceli". I believe I don't make you disappointed with my reviews and knowledge. Take care for now, have fun at my blog and make yourself at home!</p></div>
